# LinuxShell

Project for CS 3650 at Northeastern University where I created a working Bash-like Shell written in C. The shell uses Nush, a bare bones shell, with the addition of multiple Bash features: < (redirect input), > (redirect output), | (pipe, redirect output of one command to another), && (and), || (or) and ; (execute consecutive commands).
